# Wordcloud-for-Trump-Tweets

# Repository Files

# Project Motivation
The goal of this project is to create a wordcloud for Donald Trump's tweets to analyze the most used words in his tweets during the 2020 election campaign.

# Data Source
The data I used for this project is the raw dataset of trump tweets that I found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/trump-tweets). This dataset contains tweets from July 2020 to October 2020. This timeframe allows us to capture the tweets mainly related to the 2020 election and Trump's campaign efforts.
