# Wordcloud-for-Trump-Tweets

# Repository Files

# Project Motivation
The goal of this project is to create a wordcloud for Donald Trump's tweets to analyze the most used words in his tweets during the 2020 election campaign.

# Data Source
The data that I utilize in this project is the raw dataset of trump tweets that I found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/trump-tweets). I will only use the tweets in 2020 to capture Trump's election messages.
