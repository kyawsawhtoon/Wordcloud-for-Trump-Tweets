# Project Motivation
The goal of this project is to create a wordcloud for Donald Trump's tweets to analyze the most used words in his tweets during the 2020 election campaign.

# Data Source
The data I used for this project is the raw dataset of trump tweets that I found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/trump-tweets). This dataset contains tweets from July 2020 to October 2020. This timeframe allows us to capture the tweets mainly related to the 2020 election and Trump's campaign efforts.

# Project Outcome

The following is the final wordcloud. Without any suprises, the most used words contain "Biden", "MAGA" and "Fake News". It is also interesting to see that "Pennsylvania" is one of the most used words.
